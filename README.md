# The Ranking iOS/Android dev test

This repository is aimed to test future iOS/Android developers skills. We hope you enjoy as much as we do coding and pushing your skills with new challenges.

## Introduction
In order to evaluate your skills and coding style we would like you to develop a small application that consumes [HERE map API](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/transit/topics/overview.html).
Use case
We would like to have an small application that to achieve:
* Searching the station around your current location

* Displaying the station info after selecting it, inlcuding weather info, next departures info at the station in differnet view


## How to get started
Check out the [HERE documentation](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/transit/topics/overview.html) to know how to get the API information. Please sign up a free account at [here](https://developer.here.com/plans/api/consumer-mapping) to start with. We recommend you to visit [this link](https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/rest) and [Rest APIs](https://developer.here.com/develop/rest-apis) for more api details.

### Procedure
* You do not need to do both iOS and Android, you pick the one, either iOS or Android, that you are most comformable with. 
* You will be added to the repo to start with, you will be creating the project and using github to track each commit. 
* When you think your app matches the requirements and you are proud of the code, you are going to push, make a pull request to this repository. We will review your code and we will likely make some comments about your code.
* In your pull request, add a description of the solution you have implemented and any other issue we should take into account at the time of review.

### Requirements
## iOS
* The candidate is allowed to use third party libraries. 
* The candidate should use both objective-c and swift in the project to demonstrate you are expert of the languages
* The candidate must chose the UI that fits better, but the Views must be done using both SwiftUI (imperative programming) and NIB (declarative programming) for each view.
* The candidate must use MVVM as the app architecutre pattern
* There is no time limit for the test but plesae do your best to finish it within 3 hours once started coding.

## Android
* The candidate is allowed to use third party libraries. 
* The candidate should use both java and kotlin in the project to demonstrate you are expert of the languages
* The candidate must chose the UI that fits better, but the Views must be done using both jetpack compose (imperative programming) and xml (declarative programming) for each view. 
* The candidate must use MVVM as the app architecutre pattern
* The candidate must use Hilt or Dagger as Dependent Injection pattern.
* There is no time limit for the test but plesae do your best to finish it within 3 hours once started coding.

### Optional
* The local caching mechanism should be considered
* The use of animations will be a plus.

## Advices
* Be aware of user experience and try to cover all the scenario
* Knowledge of design patterns.
* Any necessaries process to make sure the quality of the code.
* Clean code.
* Please avoid ONE BIG git commit - this will be treated as failure of the test
